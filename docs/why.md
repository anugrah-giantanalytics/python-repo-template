# Architectural Decisions and Design Philosophy

## Overview

This document explains the architectural decisions behind our Python microservice template, specifically designed to support components in the Grayscope Legal architecture, including Middleware, Indexer, Upsertion, and Retriever services.

## Core Architectural Principles

### 1. Microservice-First Design

- **Why**: The template is designed for building independent, scalable microservices that can be part of a larger distributed system.
- **Benefits**:
  - Independent deployment and scaling
  - Technology stack isolation
  - Failure isolation
  - Clear service boundaries
- **Use Cases**:
  - Retriever Service: Handles document retrieval with its own caching and optimization
  - Indexer Service: Manages document indexing independently
  - Middleware: Acts as an intermediary between different system components
  - Upsertion Service: Handles document updates and insertions

### 2. FastAPI as the Framework

- **Why**: FastAPI is chosen for its performance, async support, and automatic OpenAPI documentation.
- **Benefits**:
  - High performance with async/await support
  - Automatic API documentation (Swagger/ReDoc)
  - Type checking with Pydantic
  - Built-in security features
- **Use Cases**:
  - Query Endpoints: Fast processing of user queries
  - Document Processing: Async handling of document operations
  - API Gateway: Efficient routing and request handling

### 3. Structured Logging

- **Why**: Using structlog for consistent, machine-parseable logs across all services.
- **Benefits**:
  - JSON-formatted logs for better parsing
  - Consistent log structure across services
  - Context-aware logging
  - Easy integration with log aggregation tools
- **Use Cases**:
  - Request Tracing: Track requests across services
  - Error Monitoring: Structured error logs for better debugging
  - Performance Monitoring: Log timing information consistently

## Directory Structure Explained

### `/app`

- **Core Application Code**
  ```
  app/
  ├── api/          # API routes and endpoints
  ├── core/         # Core functionality
  ├── models/       # Data models
  ├── services/     # Business logic
  └── utils/        # Utility functions
  ```
- **Why This Structure**:
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Easy to locate specific functionality
  - Scalable as the application grows
  - Follows Python best practices

#### 1. `/app/api`

- **Purpose**: Houses all API endpoints and route definitions
- **Why**:
  - Separates routing logic from business logic
  - Makes API versioning easier
  - Centralizes endpoint documentation
- **Use Cases**:
  - Query Endpoints: `/api/v1/query`
  - Document Operations: `/api/v1/documents`
  - Health Checks: `/health`

#### 2. `/app/core`

- **Purpose**: Essential application components
- **Components**:
  - Configuration management
  - Logging setup
  - Database connections
  - Security middleware
- **Why**:
  - Centralizes critical infrastructure code
  - Makes configuration management consistent
  - Easier to maintain core functionality

#### 3. `/app/models`

- **Purpose**: Data models and schemas
- **Why**:
  - Clear data structure definitions
  - Type safety with Pydantic
  - Consistent data validation
- **Use Cases**:
  - Document Models
  - Query Models
  - Response Models

#### 4. `/app/services`

- **Purpose**: Business logic implementation
- **Why**:
  - Separates business logic from API layer
  - Makes unit testing easier
  - Promotes code reuse
- **Use Cases**:
  - Document Processing Service
  - Query Processing Service
  - Authentication Service

#### 5. `/app/utils`

- **Purpose**: Shared utility functions
- **Why**:
  - Prevents code duplication
  - Common functionality in one place
  - Easy to maintain shared code

## Development Tools and Configuration

### 1. UV Package Manager

- **Why UV over pip**:
  - Significantly faster package installation
  - Better dependency resolution
  - Built-in virtual environment management
  - Improved caching
  - Parallel downloads

### 2. Docker Configuration

- **Why Multi-stage Builds**:
  - Smaller final image size
  - Separation of build and runtime dependencies
  - Better security with minimal runtime image
  - Faster deployments

### 3. Environment Management

- **Why Using .envrc and .env**:
  - Development environment consistency
  - Secure credential management
  - Easy environment variable management
  - direnv integration for automatic environment loading

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Test Structure

- **Why Mirroring App Structure**:
  ```
  tests/
  ├── api/          # API tests
  ├── services/     # Service tests
  └── utils/        # Utility tests
  ```
- **Benefits**:
  - Easy to locate tests
  - Clear test organization
  - Maintains test coverage visibility

### 2. Testing Tools

- **Why These Choices**:
  - pytest: Powerful testing framework
  - pytest-cov: Coverage reporting
  - pytest-asyncio: Async test support
